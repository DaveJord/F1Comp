# F1 Competition Rules

## 1. How to Play

For each race, a player will select 5 drivers to place 1st to 5th. There will be two additional questions per race, a Head to Head between two drivers where a player picks which driver they think will finish ahead, and a bonus question. The H2H and Bonus questions will be decided after qualying.

### Bet Types

There will be 3 main bet types, Regular, Pre-Qualy and All or Nothing. Bet types do not affect H2H or Bonus questions.

1. Regular: Regular bets are placed after qualying and pre race, players place their 1st to 5th selection. This is a standard bet and there is no additional bonus awarded.

2. Pre-Qualy: Players place their 1st to 5th selection before qualying starts for a 50% bonus in points received.

3. All or nothing: Players must guess the finishing order from 1st to 5th, if all selected drivers place in the correct position, players receive a 200% bonus in points received. If one or more of the selected drivers are out of position, no points are awarded.


## 2. Prize Structure

## 3. Main Competition Rules

1. Pre-Season Questions Bonus is applied to a players total race points after Abu Dhabi GP. 

2. Answers to the Pre Season Questions will be determined by the admins ( David and Steven ) based on the results of each race, these will be shared before we apply the bonus points to ensure consensus. 

3. Each players race selection should be provided no later than 30 minutes before the scheduled start time of each race, if not provided, the players selection from the previous race will be applied. If not provided for the first race, drivers that qualify in 4th, 5th and 6th will be used as podium selection and 1st position will be used as DNF selection. All players selections will be shared before the start of each race. 

    3a: Earlier submission of race selections may be required where the race start time in UTC is deemed "Too early for this craic". Players will be notified prior to GP qualification if this rule applies. 

4. Results will be based on the finishing position of drivers at the end of each race, however, if final results are later revised by FIA due to DSQ, Penalty etc, Results will be updated to match the new finishing positions.

5. In the event a race is cancelled, there will be no points distributed for that weekend.

6. If two or more players are tied for any of the prize awarding positions in the leaderboard, the FIA countback procedure will be completed to compare each players results over the entire season to determine the final finishing position of each player. If still even after countback, prize will be split.

7. Players selections for each race should be in the format "1st, 2nd, 3rd, DNF" e.g. "PIA, VER, HAM, RUS", other variations, including either a drivers full name, first name, surname are acceptable, provided it uniquely identifies that driver and it is clear what classification the player intended. "None" is also a valid selection for DNF and is awarded the same points as a correct DNF if no driver is classified as DNF.

8. There may be stewards randomly assigned from the pool of players for each race to answer any further questions pertaining to that race.

9. In the event of the untimely demise of any of the players, while unfortunate, of course, their entry fee is considered forfeit to the competition prize fund and shall not be redeemed by any beneficiaries. Their finishing position in the competition is also forfeit and those players who scored less but who had the good manners not to demise themselves, move up a position.

3. Question 11, while “races” have not been specified here, this question only applies to final classification in GP races.

4. Question 12, replacement is counted provided it is for the remainder of the season, a replacement for one or more race in the event of illness, race ban etc does not count. This also applies to the final race of the season, for example, the final race of 2024, Ocon for Alpine, this would be considered a replacement. 

5. Question 13, This will be based on the position of Norris at the end of the first lap of the race, starting the second lap of the race.
